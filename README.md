# Project README

## Project Overview

This collaborative project, developed by a team of three, focuses on designing a dynamic website using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The primary objective of the web application is to provide users with a list of random activities to do when boredom strikes. Leveraging the MERN stack, each team member contributed their expertise in frontend and backend programming to create a cohesive and engaging web experience.

## Team Members

- Kiraly Bence
- Incze Panna
- Lichtner Levente

## Project Components

### Frontend

Our frontend is built with React, utilizing various components to enhance the user experience.

### Backend

The server side of the web page is powered by Express.js, building and configuring the backend to handle data and requests effectively.

## Dockerization

To simplify the deployment process, we have dockerized the application using Docker Compose. This allows for easy setup and reproducibility of the development environment.

## Getting Started
